## Description

A Jupyter notebook with a description of the problem/data, exploratory data analysis (EDA) procedure, analysis (model building and training), result, and discussion/conclusion. 

## Getting Started

### Installing

*Install the following libraries
- pandas
- numpy

- keras

*Download the test and train images at https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/histopathologic-cancer-detection/data. 

### Executing the Jupyter Notebook
Modify the location of the images because I ran it on my local computer directory which is cell 4 on the Jupyter Noebook.

## Data

The train_labels.csv file provides the ground truth for the images in the train folder. This file is located in this repository at "./data/histopathologic-cancer-detection/"
