# Project Title

CNN Cancer Detection Kaggle Mini-Project for course DTSA-5511 Week 3

## Description

A Jupyter notebook with a description of the problem/data, exploratory data analysis (EDA) procedure, analysis (model building and training), result, and discussion/conclusion. 

## Problem
With the help of Machine Learning, use the Convolution Neural Network (CNN) algorithm to identify metastatic cancer in small image patches taken from larger digital pathology scans.

## Data

The train_labels.csv file provides the ground truth for the images in the train folder. This file is located in this repository at "./data/histopathologic-cancer-detection/"
Test and train images at [Histopathologic Cancer Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/histopathologic-cancer-detection/data)
